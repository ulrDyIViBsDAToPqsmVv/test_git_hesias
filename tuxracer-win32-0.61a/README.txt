Requirements: You'll need a video card with fairly good
hardware-accelerated OpenGL support.  A card with Voodoo2-type
performance or better is recommended.

Usage: Run tuxracer.exe.  A config directory and config\options file
will be created if necessary; use a text editor (e.g. notepad) to edit
the options there.  The options file itself is well-commented.
